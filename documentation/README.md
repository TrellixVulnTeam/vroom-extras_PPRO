# Ideal Workflow
## In Development:
1. Filter the tasks by your name
2. Check the Code Review / QA Column and finish those tasks first
3. If Code Review / QA is complete, then move on to any assigned tasks
4. If assigned tasks are complete, then move on to any unassigned tasks that you feel comfortable with

## In Data Entry:
It is everyone's responsibility to help build up the database. In order to accomplish this goal, we are asking that every team member contribute one module every day. A module is defined as a specific car's complete maintence schedule for a given model year complete with task title, description, and severity. You may do more than one in a day if you wish, but please get at least one done so that we maintain momentum.

Lessons Learned from using Android Studio to run our app in an emulator:

-Follow this tutorial VERY CLOSELY! (Click on the Building Projects with Native Code tab) 
     If you skip a step it will cause you lots of problems that are difficult to unwind!
     https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
     
     


-When setting up the environment variable ANDROID_HOME and adding tools and platform-tools to your PATH: 
      -I did this (except for Windows), and it still didn't work. When I tried to build the app, 
               I got an error that said it could not find the sdk. This persisted even though I tried a few different things 
               (e.g. creating a file called local.properties in the root directory of the project, containing the line "sdk.dir = PATH_TO_SDK")

      -I eventually had to re-install Android Studio. When I reinstalled it and opened a sample project, it prompted me to set the path to the SDK

-IMPORTANT: Once Android Studio is installed, you should create a sample project with it and open that! This will do a few things:
	-It will give you access to the Android Virtual Device Manager, which is how you run the Android emulator 
                 that needs to be running before you build the react-native project
	-It will give you some popups that are very useful:
		-Ex: a popup told me that I forgot to install the build-tools
		-KEY: a popup prompted me to set the path for the sdk folder

-Install yarn, as per Connick's directions (if you want to see those, search "directions" in the GitHub repository)
